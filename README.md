This repository is for practicing building and editing a survey form.
I will add a file.  
I will edit the file and push changes to origin repo.
I edited the file survey.txt to make the options visible in the dropdown menu.
I commited this change to main repository.
Next I will work on making the options visible for the radio buttons on the survey.
